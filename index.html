<p>While Adding your Bank Card During The Withdrawal Process, Make Sure That You Add Your Bank's Name As "ICIC" Irrespective Of The Name Of Your Bank To Avoid Withdrawal Issues. For Example: My Bank's Name Is "XYZ" Bank But I Will Have To Use "ICIC" In The Field Requiring My Bank's Name To Avoid Withdrawal Issues. </p>
